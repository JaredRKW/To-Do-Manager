To-Do Manager

Simple To-Do Manager ran from the command-line. Windows only support at the moment.

While there should be a '.exe' being provided with the repo, it is recommended to build yourself. 
Instructions to build using MSVC Compiler:
	1. Clone the git repo
	2. In a console, cd to the project's root folder: 
				eg: cd C:/Users/username/whatever/blah/To-Do Manager
	3. Compile main.cpp and test_data.cpp
				eg: cl /EHsc main.cpp test_data.cpp
	4. Now a .exe file should be in the root folder of the project. Simply run and enjoy!
